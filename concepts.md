## Concepts and Models
<p>Here is an overview of the broad concepts and models that we worked on this week: </p>

### What is a library?
We each did drawings that represented functions and services of the library. Here are the two that survived the week:

### Project Planning
<p>We worked through how to manage projects (our own and for others) and best practices for making a project plan. We then moved through two different project planning tools:</p>
* [Socio-technical Sustainability Roadmap](https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/)
* [Yale DH Lab - Starting a Project](http://dhlab.yale.edu/guides.html)

We all created plans for our own projects!
