We also explored the really great spreadsheet-database hybrid, [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), a propietary software that makes working with data across spreadsheets much easier than Excel.

Finally, if you have done really excellent work and need to make your host your own website, we talked a lot about the great services offered by [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/), which was started by some great EdTech folks and has great integration with a lot of content management tools and other great things. Check them out!
